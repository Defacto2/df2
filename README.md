# df2

![Go](https://github.com/Defacto2/df2/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

df2 is a command-line tool for managing and optimising the files and database of defacto2.net. It is broken down into five parts.

**approve** approves all validated file records that are ready to go live.

**clean** used to discover and remove orphan files that exist on the server but have no matching database entries.

**demozoo** interacts with the Demozoo.org API to synchronise data and fetch linked download files.

**fix** repairs malformed data and generates missing assets from distinct sources plus batch-approve pre-screened files.

**html** generates HTML pages for groups, peoples and the site map.

**new** handles new demozoo and proof submissions and repairs any malformed data.

**proof** automates the parsing of files tagged as _releaseproof_.

### Compile and install

This program does not compile or install on Windows due to [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [x/sys/unix](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sys/unix?tab=doc) requirements.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Defacto2/df2.git
cd df2
go install
df2 --version
```

### Dependencies

The `df2 fix text` command requires the installation of [AnsiLove/C](https://github.com/ansilove/ansilove) to the system PATH.

### Configuration

To view and test the database and directory configurations.

```bash
df2 config info
```

To change the configuration.

```bash
df2 config edit

### Development notes

df2 uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and Go v1.14.

It requires the use of the `go xxx -mod=vendor` argument which is set as default from v.1.14 onwards.

`go env` should return either `GO111MODULE=on` or `GO111MODULE=auto`.

#### Updating dependencies

```bash
go list -m all # List all direct and indirect dependencies

go list -u -m all # List all possible upgrades

go get -u ./... # Update all (major)

go get -u=patch ./... # Patch update all (minor)

go build ./... # Build all

go test ./... # Test all

go mod tidy # clean go.mod by removing all unused dependencies
```
