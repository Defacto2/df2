## Install or update

`df2` is built on [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and is packaged for [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/intro/index).

```bash
# download the package
wget https://github.com/Defacto2/df2/releases/latest/download/df2.deb

# install or update the package
dpkg -i df2.deb

# test the new install
df2 --version
```

### Dependencies

- The `df2 fix text` command requires the installation of [AnsiLove/C](https://github.com/ansilove/ansilove) in the system `PATH`.
- [WebP support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) image conversion needs [libwebp](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html). 
- PNG image compression relies on [pngquant](https://pngquant.org). 
- Image conversion needs both [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) and [netpbm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/).

#### Dependency installation on Ubuntu

```bash
# required dependencies
sudo apt install -y ansilove imagemagick netpbm pngquant webp

# optional file archivers
sudo apt install -y arj lhasa unrar unzip
```

### Database dependancy

The `df2` program expects local access to the [Defacto2 database](https://github.com/Defacto2/database).

## Configuration

To view and test the [database](https://github.com/Defacto2/database) and directory configurations.

```bash
df2 config info
```

To change the configuration.

```bash
df2 config edit
```

## Docker container

The Docker container runs on a [Go container](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) built in Debian Linux. 
The main purpose is unit testing and compiling of the Go source code in a Linux environment.

```sh
# change directory to the local repository
cd df2
# synchronize any remote repository tags
git pull 
# build the current directory as an image tagged as 'df2'
docker build --tag df2 . 
# run the image tagged as 'df2' with the container name 'df2-test'
docker run -it --name df2-test df2
```

## Use the code on your own system

Confirm the installation of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) on Linux, WSL or macOS.

```sh
$ go version

go version go1.19.5 linux/amd64
```

Clone the `Defacto2/df2` repository.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Defacto2/df2.git

Cloning into 'df2'...
```

Run the `df2` tool. It may take a moment on the first run as it downloads dependencies.

```sh
$ cd df2
$ go run . --version

  version  0.0.0 (developer build)
     path  /tmp/go-build3011510136/b001/exe/df2
   commit  unknown
     date  unknown
       go  v1.19.5 linux/amd64
```

Build the `df2` tool (not usually required).

```sh
$ cd df2
$ go build
$ ./df2 --version

  version  0.0.0 (developer build)
     path  /home/ben/df2/df2
   commit  3352b5393353d4e09cf19f636d4be593d961cece
     date  2023 Jan 3, 02:01 UTC
       go  v1.19.5 linux/amd64
```

## Releasing

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) combined with [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) handles the building process when new release tags are created.

All changes should be tested with the `golangci-lint` [Go linters aggregator](https://golangci-lint.run/).
