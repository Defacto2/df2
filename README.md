# df2

![Go](https://github.com/Defacto2/df2/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

df2 is a command-line tool for managing plus optimising the files and database of defacto2.net. It is broken down into five parts.

**approve** all validated file records that are ready to go live.

**clean** discover and remove orphan files that exist on the server but have no matching database entries.

**config** adjust the default settings for this `df2` tool.

**demozoo** interacts with the [Demozoo.org API](http://demozoo.org/api/v1/) to synchronise data and fetch linked download files.

**fix** malformed data and generates missing assets from distinct sources.

**lookup** a website record URL by its database ID or UUID.

**new** checks Demozoo and _#releaseproof_ submissions, fetches downloads, generate previews and repairs any malformed data.

**output** generates webpages for groups, peoples and the site map.

**proof** automates the parsing of files tagged as _#releaseproof_.

### Compile and install

Requires [Go v1.14+](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed and it will not compile or install on Windows due to [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [x/sys/unix](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sys/unix?tab=doc) requirements.

```bash
cd $(mktemp -d)
git clone git@github.com:Defacto2/df2.git .
go install -race
df2 --version
```

### Dependencies

The `df2 fix text` command requires the installation of [AnsiLove/C](https://github.com/ansilove/ansilove) to the system PATH.

Image conversion for [WebP support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) needs [libwebp](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html).

### Development notes

df2 uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and Go v1.14.

Windows IDE users should have the `CGO_ENABLED=0` environment variable set for testing.

go list -m all # List all direct and indirect dependencies

go list -u -m all # List all possible upgrades

go get -u ./... # Update all (major)

go get -u=patch ./... # Patch update all (minor)

go build ./... # Build all
