# df2

df2 is a command-line tool for managing and optimising the files and database of defacto2.net. It is broken down into five parts.

**clean** used to discover and remove orphan files that exist on the server but have no matching database entries.

**demozoo** interacts with the Demozoo.org API to synchronise data and fetch linked download files.

**fix** repairs malformed data and generates missing assets from distinct sources plus batch-approve pre-screened files.

**html** generates HTML pages for groups, peoples and the site map.

**proof** automates the parsing of files tagged as *release-proof*.
