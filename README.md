## Install

df2 is built on [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and is packaged for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/index) Linux.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Defacto2/df2/releases/latest/download/df2.deb
dpkg -i df2.deb # also works for updating
df2 --version
```

### Dependencies

The `df2 fix text` command requires the installation of [AnsiLove/C](https://github.com/ansilove/ansilove) in the system `PATH`.

[WebP support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) image conversion needs [libwebp](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html). PNG image compression relies on [pngquant](https://pngquant.org). Image conversion needs both [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) and [netpbm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/).

#### Ubuntu installation

```bash
sudo apt install -y ansilove imagemagick netpbm pngquant webp
# optional file archivers
sudo apt install -y arj lhasa unrar unzip
```

## Configuration

To view and test the database and directory configurations.

```bash
df2 config info
```

To change the configuration.

```bash
df2 config edit
```

## Docker container

The Docker container runs on a [Go container](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) built in Debian Linux. 
The main purpose is unit testing and compiling of the Go source code in a Linux environment.

```sh
# change directory to the local repository
cd df2
# synchronize any remote repository tags
git pull 
# build the current directory as an image tagged as 'df2'
docker build --tag df2 . 
# run the image tagged as 'df2' with the container name 'df2-test'
docker run -it --name df2-test df2
```

## Source code and building

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) combined with [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) handles the building process when new release tags are created.

All changes should be tested with the `golangci-lint` [Go linters aggregator](https://golangci-lint.run/).
