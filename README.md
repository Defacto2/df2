# df2

![Go](https://github.com/Defacto2/df2/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

df2 is a command-line tool for managing plus optimising the files and database of defacto2.net. It is broken down into five parts.

**approve** all validated file records that are ready to go live.

**clean** discover and remove orphan files that exist on the server but have no matching database entries.

**config** adjust the default settings for this `df2` tool.

**demozoo** interacts with the [Demozoo.org API](http://demozoo.org/api/v1/) to synchronise data and fetch linked download files.

**fix** malformed data and generates missing assets from distinct sources.

**lookup** a website record URL by its database ID or UUID.

**new** checks Demozoo and _#releaseproof_ submissions, fetches downloads, generate previews and repairs any malformed data.

**output** generates webpages for groups, peoples and the site map.

**proof** automates the parsing of files tagged as _#releaseproof_.
